      design rule checking, and can provide industry standard RS-274X
      (Gerber), NC drill, and centroid data (X-Y data) output for use in
      the board fabrication and assembly process, as well as
      photorealistic and design review images.

      PCB offers high end features such as an autorouter and trace
      optimizer which can tremendously reduce layout time.

      For custom requirements, PCB offers a plug-in API for inserting
